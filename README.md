## Alumunium Solutions section:

i want to have a section called alumunium_solution in the home page. this partial page already created in the app/views/home/alumunium_solutions.html.erb

i want to have this section to be the same as the screenshots, heres the details about how it should be:

1. theres a five different images that will display using wow animation with fade in up effect.
2. and after the image are positioned, i like to have some floating effect on every images.
3. and also put some box-shadow on every images, so it feels like a floating card.
4. while user hover on the image, the image will have a zoom effect
5. on hover the image, the image also have an overlay black color with opacity 0.5 (this can be adjusted).
6. and also while hovering the image, the image will be little bit skewed to the left or right or bottom or top randomly.
7. the text description will displayed on the center of all other images using wow animation with fade in effect, but very slowly.
8. the text description will also have a shinny or glowing effect. the color is black.
9. for assets or sample images, i will provide it to you. you can use inside vendor/assets/images/ folder. the filename is placeholder-1.jpg, placeholder-2.jpg, placeholder-3.jpg, placeholder-4.jpg, placeholder-5.jpg.

i want you to give me a reference online or some plugin / library can be use for implement this section.
